# Day 36 assignment

## having issues
- I'm having issues with Backbone overwriting the docTextContent attribute on the Doc model.
- instead of leaving it as the string, it replaces it with an object that looks like the model itself.
- for the sake of finishing this assignment, I have decided to hard code the text into an object on the store, rather than set up a collection
